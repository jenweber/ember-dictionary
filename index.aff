# Ember dictionary affix file
# The settings, PFX and SFX are duplicated from the orginal SCOWL files
# found at http://wordlist.aspell.net/dicts/

# REP is used to provide alternatives when a mispelt word is found and will be
# the suggested spelling/format to replace the mispelt word.  This can be used to
# enforce cosnsitency in the Ember guides.  

# In most cases, these will be the only words offered as replacements. In some cases,
# like `css`, additional alternatives will be offered besides `CSS`

# DO NOT change anything other than REP values!!

# 1 - Insert replacements in alphabetical order to make it easier to manage
# 2 - The number at the top of the list is the number of REPs.  This is for buffer sizing and
#     doesn't need to be 100% accuratue but should be maintained as exact count
# 3 - if the replacement is to be multiple works put an underscore between them - see EmberObserver
